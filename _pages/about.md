<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Arlington. My research focuses on computer vision and medical image super-resolution, aiming to enhance the quality and diagnostic value of MRI and CT images through deep learning. I am currently working on developing advanced reconstruction models for cardiac MRI.

I enjoy tackling interdisciplinary challenges that bridge artificial intelligence and healthcare, with the goal of translating computational innovations into practical clinical tools. Outside of research, I’m an ENFP who values creativity and collaboration. In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball and badminton, which keep me energized and balanced.
