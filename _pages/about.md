<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am an incoming PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Arlington. My research interests include computer vision and medical image analysis, with a focus on cardiac MRI segmentation. I completed my undergraduate studies in Biomedical Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

I enjoy interdisciplinary challenges that combine healthcare and artificial intelligence, and I'm passionate about using technology to support real-world clinical applications. Outside of research, I’m an ENFP who thrives on creativity and collaboration. In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball and badminton, which keep me active and balanced.
